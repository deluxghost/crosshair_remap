# Crosshair Remap

Allows player to map a style of crosshair to another, including custom ones.

## Map to Vanilla Crosshairs

Simply choose you desired crosshairs in the Mod Options.

For a list of vanilla crosshair styles, see [here](doc/vanilla_crosshairs.md).

## Map to Custom Crosshairs

Put your crosshair lua file(s) in `Warhammer 40,000 DARKTIDE/mods/crosshair_remap/custom_crosshairs/`, then add you filename(s) to `LIST.lua`. Your crosshair files will be loaded when the game boots. Remember to choose them in the Mod Options!

**NOTE:** The name of your file(s) must not be the same as [those predefined style names](doc/vanilla_crosshairs.md).

The mod comes with some custom crosshairs too. Take a look at the `custom_crosshairs/` directory.

## Making Custom Crosshairs

For now you can use in-game textures to compose your own crosshair.
